Q.1 What are the conditional Operators in Java ?
Ans. It is a ternary operator
     <operand1>?<operand2>:<operand3>
     operand1 must be boolean type
     if operand1 is true then it will returned operand2 otherwise it will returned operand3.
     
     
Q.2 What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
Ans  Three Types of Operators based on number of operands:
      1. Unary Operator
      2. Binary Operator
      3. Ternary Operator
      
Q.3  What is the use of Switch case in java programming?
Ans   Switch Statements allows the programme to select one action among multiple actions during program execution.

Q.4  what is the priority level for arithmetic operator in java ?
Ans  unary:                +exp   -exp
     multiplicative:       *   /  %
     Additive:              +   -
     
Q.5 What are the conditional StateMents and use of conditional statements in Java ?
Ans Conditional statements in Java are the executable block of code (or branch to a specific code) dependent on certain conditions. 
    These statements are also known as decision statements or selection statements in Java.
    Conditional statement in java:
    if statement
    If-else statement
    If Elseif statement
    
Q.6  What is the syntax of if-else statement?
Ans. Syntax of If-else statement
     if(condition){
     statement
     }else{
     statement
     }
     
 Q.7   what are 3 types of iterative statements in java ?
 Ans  Iterative statement in java:
      for statement
      while statement 
      do-while statement
      
Q.8    Write the difference between for loop and do-while loop?
Ans    In for loop program, for loop is used when the number of iterations is known,
       whereas execution is done in the do-while loop until the statement in the program is proved wrong.
       
Q.9    Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10.
Ans    package com.loops.statement;

public class Lab164 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n=10;
        for(int i=1; i<=10; i++){
            System.out.println(i);
    }
    }
}
